# AdventOfCode2020

This is my attempt at doing the [2020 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
I started late, so I probably won't be up-to-date with the latest problem.
The Advent Of Code is a fun little set of puzzles laid out in the style of an Advent calendar that you can solve with programming. Find out more here at its [about page](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about).

This is just for fun and language learning so please don't run any of this code in production.

## Structure
I'll be laying this out in directories named day# with solution files for each part of the challenge.
Tests will all be in one directory with a new test per day. IE:
```
__test__/
├── testDay1.ts
lib/
├── common
├──── helper_module.ts
├── day1/
├──── day1_part1.ts
├──── day1_part2.ts
```
